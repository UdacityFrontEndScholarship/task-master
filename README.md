# Usage
This is an online goal setting app where the number of goals and tasks to be done are written down and includes various additional features. 

# Background
TaskMaster is an opensource software created with the help of Udacity scholars in front end web development. This software is made with a hope and a vision that the traditional way of setting everyday TO-DO's and goals should be replaced with a more advanced version for the modern digitized era.
  
# Key Features


## Probable Front End Work

 - Home page/landing page setup 
 - Activating and linking the different sites from the home page
 - Linking the different additional pages to the homepage
 - Adding more tabs in the additional navigation bar
 - Making the layout of different additional pages
 - Beautifying pages in the best way possible and with special emphasis on visual appearance
 - Beautifying the <user_home_page>(after someone has logged in)[refer to pg. 3 of the pdf] after backend work has been completed
   provides a basic structure
 - Designing the alarm feature (along with popups)
 - Implementing the notification of upcoming goal deadlines and important goals feed

## Probable Back End Work

- Getting the Contact Me form in the landing(home) page to actually be able to contact someone
- Getting the Login with Google feature to actually work
- Designing a sync feature with your Gmail account
- Attaching pictures with your goals
- Devise a system to prioritize your goals
- Using different colors for different priority of goals

# Features in detail


<b>HOMEPAGE</b> - This page contains three sections viz. Home, Introduction & Why TaskMaster? on the navigation bar and clicking any one of them would trigger a smooth scrolling down the home page. These three sections fit into the first page of the web app. As stated in the mockup pdf there should be a ‘Tick’ in Home which when clicked on, starts an animation explaining what TaskMaster is all about. Below this, a button entitled ‘Get Started’ enables a user to visit the Login/Sign-up page. Lastly, on the footer various media links like Quora, LinkedIn can be provided. 
Other modifications can be open-ended and suggestions are welcome for improving the UI/UX!

<b>LOGIN / SIGNUP PAGE</b> - This page contains the login (for the existing users) or sign-up (for the new users) option. Signing in via Google is also supported. There is also a button to share about this app on Facebook. It includes a live background with video or canvas elements. 


<b>USER DASHBOARD</b> - This page basically would be divided into three columns with a lot of interactivity. The leftmost column will include the list of upcoming goals along with deadlines. The rightmost column includes the list of prioritized goals which can be displayed as a pop-up to the browser whenever a user opens up his/her browser. The middle column consists of a section for creating the goal itself with several buttons as follows: 
 
    Calendar Tool - This tool will set the date on which the reminder will come up as a popup.

    Alarm Popup - This tool will set the required alarm (if any) & the time of the alarm.

    Goal Priority - This tool will set the priority of the goal by assigning it a number which automatically updates the list in the
    rightmost column.

    Flash Button - This tool enables a pop-up of prioritizing goal whenever a user opens up his/her browser.

    Add Media - This tool enables a user to add any media files like images, music, videos attached with the goal when creating it.

    Create Goal - This tool will finally create the goal and the page would be updated.
     
Only the first page would include a Contact Us section which can be accessed by clicking on it as shown in the mockup pdf.
