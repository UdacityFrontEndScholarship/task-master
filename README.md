# <a name="9" href="#9"> Features in detail</a>
<b>HOMEPAGE</b> - This page contains three sections viz. Home, Introduction & Why TaskMaster? on the navigation bar and clicking any one of them would trigger a smooth scrolling down the home page. These three sections fit into the first page of the web app. As stated in the mockup pdf there should be a ‘Tick’ in Home which when clicked on, starts an animation explaining what TaskMaster is all about. Below this, a button entitled ‘Get Started’ enables a user to visit the Login/Sign-up page. Lastly, on the footer various media links like Quora, LinkedIn can be provided. 
Other modifications can be open-ended and suggestions are welcome for improving the UI/UX!

<b>LOGIN / SIGNUP PAGE</b> - This page contains the login (for the existing users) or sign-up (for the new users) option. Signing in via Google is also supported. There is also a button to share about this app on Facebook. It includes a live background with video or canvas elements. 

<b>USER DASHBOARD</b> - This page basically would be divided into three columns with a lot of interactivity. The leftmost column will include the list of upcoming goals along with deadlines. The rightmost column includes the list of prioritized goals which can be displayed as a pop-up to the browser whenever a user opens up his/her browser. The middle column consists of a section for creating the goal itself with several buttons as follows: 
 
    Calendar Tool - This tool will set the date on which the reminder will come up as a popup.

    Alarm Popup - This tool will set the required alarm (if any) & the time of the alarm.

    Goal Priority - This tool will set the priority of the goal by assigning it a number which automatically updates the list in the
    rightmost column.

    Flash Button - This tool enables a pop-up of prioritizing goal whenever a user opens up his/her browser.

    Add Media - This tool enables a user to add any media files like images, music, videos attached with the goal when creating it.

    Create Goal - This tool will finally create the goal and the page would be updated.
     
Only the first page would include a Contact Us section which can be accessed by clicking on it as shown in the mockup pdf.

   - Don't contact moderators if you see an anomaly in the code and if you think some function is not working properly. Just raise an
