These three sections fit into the first page of the web app! As stated in the mockup pdf there should be a ‘Tick’ in the Home which on clicked starts an animation explaining TaskMaster. Below this, a button entitled ‘Get Started’ enables a user to visit the Login/Sign-up page. Lastly, on the footer various media links Quora, LinkedIn can be provided. 
Other modifications are open-ended and suggestions are needed for improving UI/UX!
