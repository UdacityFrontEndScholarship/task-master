## Best practices for contribution

Anyone can contribute to our open source project, so feel free to do it. But make sure that you follow certain practices which include:

1. Make sure that git commit messages are meaningful, easy to understand and extremely specific: for e.g. 'Fixed Submit button not working properly on the user dashboard page'.
2. **Each Pull Request(PR) must solve one issue mentioned in our issues page**. In case your PR is solving any bug that is not mentioned in the issues page, then open one issue explaining the bug and then make a PR with reference to that issue.
3. While solving an issue you must make one comment saying that you are working on that issue so that we can avoid any conflict.
4. While making a PR make sure you reference your issue id (#1, #2 etc.) in the commit message or title.
4. Make sure you squash your commit if there are more than 2 commits in your Pull Request. In case of difficulties feel free to ask for any assistance.
5. While making any Pull Request for the UI make sure you attach one screenshot showing the final result or the bug which you have solved.
6. While creating any issue make sure you mention all the procedures required to generate that bug/error and have one brief description about that bug.
7. Last but not the least, ALWAYS follow standard coding practices, naming conventions and the regular document object model (DOM).
